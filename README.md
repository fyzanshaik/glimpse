## üîß How It Works: A Technical Deep Dive

Glimpse uses a sophisticated, multi-layered approach to provide a seamless and secure preview experience.

### 1. Smart Event Handling

Instead of listening for a `click` event, Glimpse listens for `mousedown` with comprehensive error handling. This event fires earlier, allowing the extension to reliably intercept link activation before a website's scripts can interfere. Essential for compatibility with complex, single-page applications.

### 2. Secure Sandboxed Previews

Previews are loaded into sandboxed `<iframe>` elements with strict security policies (`allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-popups allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation`). This isolates previewed content from the main page and prevents malicious actions.

### 3. Intelligent Network Layer

Uses `declarativeNetRequest` API to selectively modify security headers like `X-Frame-Options` and `Content-Security-Policy`, but only for `sub_frame` requests. Includes smart exclusions for Cloudflare domains and challenge pages.

### 4. Cloudflare Detection System

Advanced detection system that identifies Cloudflare challenge pages using multiple indicators:
- DOM elements (`.cf-challenge-container`, `#cf-challenge-stage`, etc.)
- Text content analysis ("checking your browser", "security check", etc.)  
- Script and meta tag detection
- URL pattern matching (`cdn-cgi`, `__cf_chl_`, etc.)

When detected, the extension automatically disables itself to prevent interference with human verification.

### 5. Enterprise-Grade Error Handling

- **Timeout Protection**: All operations have configurable timeouts
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries for network failures (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- **Graceful Degradation**: Multiple fallback strategies for every critical operation
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and garbage collection
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive URL and DOM element validation

### Permissions & Justification

| Permission                  | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `declarativeNetRequest`     | Essential for core preview functionality. Used in a narrowly scoped way to allow websites to be embedded in preview frames. Includes smart exclusions for Cloudflare and security-sensitive domains.                                                                                                                                        |
| `host_permissions: <all_urls>` | Required to: **1)** Inject content script for `Ctrl+Click` detection on any page. **2)** Enable `declarativeNetRequest` for any potential link destination. Without this, preview functionality would be limited to a predefined set of websites. |

### Data Handling Commitment

*   **Zero Data Collection:** Glimpse does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or browsing history.
*   **Local Processing:** All logic and data handling happens locally on your machine.
*   **No Remote Code:** Extension does not fetch or execute remote code, ensuring behavior is fixed and verifiable.
*   **Transparent Operations:** All network modifications are logged and can be monitored in developer console.

### Security Features

- **Sandboxed Execution**: All previewed content runs in isolated iframes
- **Header Modification Logging**: All network modifications are logged for transparency
- **Input Sanitization**: All URLs and user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Memory Protection**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks and data persistence
- **Cross-Origin Safety**: Robust handling of cross-origin restrictions
